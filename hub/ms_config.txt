# This is a sample silent configuration response file

# To configure a TEMS using this silent response file:
#   1) copy this file to another location and modify the necessary parameters
#   2) run "itmcmd config -S -p <silent_response_file> -t <tems_name>"
#      - give an absolute path for the silent_response_file

# Syntax rules:
# - Comment lines begin with "#"
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Parameter lines are PARAMETER=value (do not put space before the PARAMETER)
# - Space before or after an equal sign is OK
# - Parameter values should NOT contain the following characters $, =, or |
